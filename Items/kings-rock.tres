:   Holder's damaging moves have a 10% chance to make their target flinch.  This chance applies independently to each hit of a multi-hit move.

e.g., a move with a 30% chance to flinch normally will have a 37% total chance to flinch when used with this item, because 3% of the time, both effects activate.
