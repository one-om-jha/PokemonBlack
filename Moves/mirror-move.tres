effect = "Uses the last move targeted at the user by a Pokémon still on the field.  A move counts as targeting the user even if it hit multiple Pokémon, as long as the user was one of them; however, moves targeting the field itself do not count.  If the user has not been targeted by an appropriate move since entering the field, or if no Pokémon that targeted the user remains on the field, this move will fail.

Moves that failed, missed, had no effect, or were blocked are still copied.

Assist moves, time-delayed moves, “meta” moves that operate on other moves/Pokémon/abilities, and some other special moves cannot be copied and are ignored; if the last move to hit the user was such a move, the previous move will be used instead.
