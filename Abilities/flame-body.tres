effect = "Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being burned.

Overworld: If any Pokémon in the party has this ability, each egg in the party has its hatch counter decreased by 2 (rather than 1) each step cycle, making eggs hatch roughly twice as quickly.  This effect does not stack if multiple Pokémon have this ability or magma armor."
flavor = "Contact with the Pokémon may burn the attacker."
