effect = "This Pokémon cannot be asleep.

This causes rest to fail altogether.  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires this ability, it will immediately wake up; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.

This ability functions identically to insomnia in battle.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased."
flavor = "The Pokémon is full of vitality, and that prevents
it from falling asleep."
