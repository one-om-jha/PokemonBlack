effect = "When this Pokémon is at full HP, any hit that would knock it out will instead leave it with 1 HP.  Regardless of its current HP, it is also immune to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, guillotine, horn drill, and sheer cold.

If this Pokémon is holding a focus sash, this ability takes precedence and the item will not be consumed."
flavor = "It cannot be knocked out with one hit. One-hit KO
moves cannot knock it out, either."
