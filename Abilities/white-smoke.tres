name = "white-smoke"
effect = "This Pokémon cannot have its stats lowered by other Pokémon.

This ability does not prevent any stat losses other than stat modifiers, such as the Speed cut from paralysis; nor self-inflicted stat drops, such as the Special Attack drop from overheat; nor opponent-triggered stat boosts, such as the Attack boost from swagger.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative stat modifiers through guard swap, heart swap, or power swap.

This ability functions identically to clear body in battle.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved."
flavor = "The Pokémon is protected by its white smoke, which
prevents other Pokémon from lowering its stats."
