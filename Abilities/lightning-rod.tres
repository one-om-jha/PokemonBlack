effect = "All other Pokémon's single-target electric-type moves are redirected to this Pokémon if it is an eligible target.  Other Pokémon's Electric moves raise this Pokémon's Special Attack one stage, negating any other effect on it, and cannot miss it.

If the move's intended target also has this ability, the move is not redirected.  When multiple Pokémon with this ability are possible targets for redirection, the move is redirected to the one with the highest Speed stat, or, in the case of a tie, to a random tied Pokémon.  follow me takes precedence over this ability.

If the Pokémon is a ground-type and thus immune to Electric moves, its immunity prevents the Special Attack boost."
flavor = "The Pokémon draws in all Electric-type moves.
Instead of being hit by Electric-type moves,
it boosts its Sp. Atk."
