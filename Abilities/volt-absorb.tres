effect = "Whenever an electric-type move hits this Pokémon, it heals for 1/4 of its maximum HP, negating any other effect on it.

This ability will not take effect if this Pokémon is ground-type and thus immune to Electric moves.  Electric moves will ignore this Pokémon's substitute.

This effect includes non-damaging moves, i.e. thunder wave."
flavor = "Restores HP if hit by an Electric-type move instead
of taking damage."
