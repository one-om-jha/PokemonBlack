Heavy rain ends when this Pokémon leaves battle or loses this ability, or when this ability is nullified.  The weather cannot otherwise be changed except by the effects of delta stream and desolate land.

air lock and cloud nine will prevent the effects of heavy rain, including allowing Fire moves to work, but will not allow the weather to be changed."

Fire-type attacks."
